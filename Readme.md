# Download Music

Don't wanna sign up to a website to download an album of music that 
whose individual songs are already available for listening on a website?
    
Don't wanna manually click through each of the download links manually 
to download each song?

Same here!
I wrote this to download some psycho pass songs available here: `http://anime.thehylia.com/soundtracks/album/psycho-pass-complete-original-soundtrack`

Modify if you need to download further than one layer of links down.
  
Why didn't you just use [`wget -r --level=2`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/Recursive-Retrieval-Options.html)
and recursively download one level? I didn't want to download all links 2 levels down, and also wanted to write something myself.
